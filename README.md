# tic-tac-toe

just run ```main.py```

the computer mode only uses random moves, and in the case it wins, you will have to finish your turn in order to get the win message.
i am not fixing this.

oh, and also run this in your command prompt (assuming you already have python):
```
pip install pygame
```
